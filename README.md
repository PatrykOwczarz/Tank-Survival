# Tank-Survival
Using an OpenGL based C++ graphics engine I have created a game which featured a tank following a Catmull-Rom spline. The primary focus of this project was to learn how graphics is rendered via the use of buffers and shaders. This project was done for my Computer Graphics module in my second year of university.
